### 🎯 Objective
To capture live network packets using Wireshark and identify different network protocols like HTTP, DNS, TCP, and ICMP.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- Wireshark (Free Network Packet Analyzer)
- Windows 10
- Browser: Google Chrome

---

### 🪜 Steps Performed
1. Installed Wireshark and opened the Wi-Fi interface for packet capture.  
2. Browsed several websites to generate network traffic.  
3. Captured packets for about one minute.  
4. Stopped capture and applied filters:
   - `dns` → Domain name lookups  
   - `tcp` → Transmission Control Protocol  
   - `icmp` → Ping requests/replies  
5. Observed packet details including source IP, destination IP, protocol, and length.  
6. Saved capture as `Task5_Wireshark.pcapng`.

### 📊 Protocols Identified
| Protocol | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **DNS** | Converts domain names into IP addresses |
| **TCP** | Reliable, connection-oriented transport |
| **ICMP** | Used for ping and network diagnostics |
